# Tech Talk Application

## Description:

The main goal of this project is to build a CMS-style blog site application from scratch following the MVC paradigm, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. After completion of the project, I have a better understanding on building an entire full stack application with user authentication and third-party npm packages do improve the functionality and user experience. I also learned how to use route handlers effectively to access, and modify a database through http requests. And lastly I learned some better ways to access data through the DOM by using event delegation with the event target.
